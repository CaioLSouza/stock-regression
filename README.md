# stock-regression

The aim of this project is to use machine learning regression models to forecast the future behavior of stock prices. To do this, we use a regression tree, a random forest and a XGBoost to forecast the stock prices of two brazilian companies: *Petrobras S.A.* and *Transmissora Aliança de Energia Elétrica (TAESA)*.
